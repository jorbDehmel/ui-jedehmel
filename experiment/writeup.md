# First UI/UX Test
Jordan Dehmel, UI Design, Spring '25

## Stakeholder Stories / Test Cases

1. "I am an intro to applied math student and I want to create a
    new document to edit, then a new file in the current
    document"
2. "I am an intro to applied math student and I want to find out
    what the 'Dockerfile' option means in the export menu, then
    open an existing document named 'hello.jmd'"
3. "I am a teacher and I want to demonstrate how to create and
    export a document to `markdown` format in my class"

## Measuring Success

1. Test case 1 will be considered a success if they are able to
    create a new document. It will be a partial success if they
    cannot create a new file. It will be a failure if they are
    not able to create a new document.
2. Test case 2 will be considered a success if they are able to
    navigate to the help menu, then to the 'Docker' menu. Then
    they should be able to navigate back to home and open an
    existing document. It will be a failure if they are unable
    to find help or to escape the help menu and open an existing
    document.
3. Test case 3 will be considered a success if they are able to
    create a new document, then successfully reach the `export`
    screen. It will be a partial success if they stop at this
    point, and a full success if they are able to change the
    default document type and export. It will be a failure if
    they are unable to create or export a document.

## Experimental Design

- Only the vaguest follow-up questions will be asked after the
    fact so as not to retroactively influence their opinions

The following are both experimental design points and things I
will say to the subject before beginning:

- I will have my paper design and simulate the computer
- I will instruct them to narrate their thoughts and actions,
    and I will simulate those actions
- I will give them a task that they will try to complete
- For text blocks and dropdowns that I have not detailed in my
    paper model, I will narrate what will be displayed.

## Choosing A Subject

Test subject criteria:

- College student
- In a math / CS class (preferably applied math)
- **Not** an experienced CS person
