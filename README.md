UI design final at CMU

## Showcase Title

Creating an Open-Source Text Editor for Static Documents with
Embedded Running Code

## Showcase Abstract

When preparing documents in math or computer science courses,
PDFs with embedded running code are often desirable.
R-markdown (RMD) is one solution to this, but is embedded in the
large rstudio application. Previous work has created the JKnit
literate programming tool, which is a lightweight and generic
command-line alternative to RMD: The current project details
iteration on a graphical text editor for JKnit as the final
project of CSCI 337 (User Interface Design).
